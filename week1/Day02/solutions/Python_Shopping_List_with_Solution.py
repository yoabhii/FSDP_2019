# Shopping List App 

"""
Challenge 1
    We are going to make a "Shopping List" app. 
    Run the script to start using it.
    Put new things into the list one at a time
    Enter the word DONE - in all CAPS - to QUIT the program
    And once i quit, I want the app to show me everything thats on my list.

Hint 1
    Step 1: Make a list to hold onto our items.
    Step 2: Print out instructions on how to use the app

    Step 3: Ask for new items
    Step 4: Add new items to our list
    Step 5: Be able to quit the app

    Step 6: print out the list

"""
Challenge 2
    If I type SHOW, 
    I should be able to see what is currently in the list

    If I type HELP, 
    I should be able to see all the help for these special commands

Hint 2
    Step 1: Have a HELP command
    Step 2: Have a SHOW command
    Step 3: Add a function for adding into the list 
    Step 4: Cleanup the code in general

Challenge 3
    User can enter SHOW or Show or show, 
    similar for DONE and HELP, but the program should do the required job

    Show the item in the list serially starting from 1

    Let us accept items using a comma separated string
        
    Also there should be a functionality to add an item at a specific index

    There should be a functionality to remove items from the list at a specific index using REMOVE
    
    Do all the exception handling for all the extreme use cases
